The game goes this way:

In your inventory,
You have 10 Pepper Pellets, which add from 75 to 100 attack points to your current ones.
You have NUFFIN' (codename The Yoinker), which was supposed to make the enemy slip on a banana or something but idk the "developer" got tired
You have 2 Candy Canes, which give you 500 Health points.

Press the first button to attack your opponent, or the Pass button to back down.
If PASSED, the enemy has a higher chance to miss or slip and hurt themselves.
